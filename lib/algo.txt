            loop on every opponent kill range
            if character present on opponent kill range
            if true
                temporaraily update positions map where that character is not present
                now check again if this paticular opponent attacks our king with his kill range
                if true
                    the character is pinned
                    break the loop
                if false

            move as normal
            
check.....


    when character pressed
    danger = true
        loop every team member if they are attacking opponent king with their kill range


        check if more than 1 member attacking the opponent king
        if true-
            no attacking
            no blocking
            only escaping

        if only 1 member is attacking the opponent king
        if true-
            check if any opponent attacking that member
            if true-
                check if that opponent is pinned or not
                if pinned true - 
                    do nothing....
                if pinned false -
                    danger = false
                    break loop
            check if any opponent blocking the attack of our member
            if true-
                check if that opponent is pinned or not
